# Functional Programing

There are the solutions to the Assignments that I completed when I took the Course. I have no idea if the assignments have changed, but I think they might have. But it is probably just the name of methods or sadly some methods have to return something else.

I have not added descriptions of the solutions, so it is very encouraged that you make the assignments yourself first. If you end up stuck you can use this to get on.

I have also added the solutions to some of the old exams under 'Old Exams/...'.
