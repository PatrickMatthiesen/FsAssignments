# Functional Programing

There are the solutions to the Assignments that I completed when I took the Course. I have no idea if the assignments have changed, but I think they might have. But it is probably just the name of methods or sadly some methods have to return something else. A TA told me that it should be mostly the same though.

I have not added descriptions of the solutions, so it is very encouraged that you make the assignments yourself first, and then first use this if you end up stuck.

I have also added the solutions to some of the old exams under 'Old Exams/...'.

I made my solutions manely in the `.fsx` files, so i would recomend you use a good editor that can allow you to mark your solutions, and then just use `alt + enter`to enter the code in the interactive session.
